What is the 'typhoeus' gem? It tells me to install it for "best performance," but I see no mention of it on the setup page. Also, this isn't a big problem, but might be helpful to say install the iron_worker gem for complete beginners.

Took me awhile to find where the supported gems are..maybe put the Ruby docs that are in GitHub on the actual website

YAML is formatted weird in some of the examples--double colon. Had to remove the extra colon to get it working in my version.

Part about running it locally is a little confusing. I got an error when I tried calling the worker.wait_until_complete method on it when I was running it locally. Pretty obvious, but worth a comment.
